# 🏭☁️ Global Co2 Emissions

## 📚 Background

This data set includes global fossil fuel emissions data from 1750 - 2021 by country, paired with population data for the same year/country detail. Historical CO2 datapoints are estimated based off of the industrial factors reflected in each time period.

This Tableau Viz was comprised from the 'Data playground' dataset within [mavenanalytics.io](https://mavenanalytics.io/) containing a csv table with 50,599 records from 1750-2021. 

## 💡 Highlights

- Developed and resource-rich countries such as the United States, Australia and countries in the Middle East exhibit high per-capita emissions (in the upper range of 20-35 tons per person)
- Large portions of Africa and parts of South Asia show ##minimal emissions per capita##, in many cases below 1 ton per person, reflecting limited industrialization and lower fossil fuel dependency
- China stands out with the world's largest total emissions, proportional to its vast population as shown in the scatterplot
- India has a similarly large population but relatively lower emissions, suggesting a less carbon-intensive economy compared to the United States having high emissions with a comparatively smaller population, signaling very high per-capita emissions and continued heavy reliance on fossil fuels
- Early industrial nations were dominating emissions in the 18th and 19th centuries
- The 20th century saw a rise in emissions from North America and Europe, peaking mid-century
- In recent decades, China's share of global emissions has surged, overtaking traditional industrial economies meanwhile, the United States and Europe has declined, though absolute emissions remain high
